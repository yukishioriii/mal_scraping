As MM only lasts 12 episodes – compared to the 24 of SG – the transition from light-hearted to terrifying feels much more sudden and due to the setting also more extreme. Nonetheless, I watched SG first and could not help but notice how likewise both anime were in terms of this specific change. Even if you don’t like certain characteristics, like the fan service in SG or the Magical Girl setting in MM, like I did, you will most likely enjoy one if you are fond of the other.

I will not go into any detail here, as that would, in my opinion, spoil a lot of the fun. So, even if you’re not into reading, I guarantee you that you will like this Light Novel series.
